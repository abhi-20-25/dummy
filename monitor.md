# Monitor Detection System

This project is a comprehensive monitoring system designed to detect the status of monitors (ON/OFF) using live video feeds from RTSP cameras. It leverages the YOLOv8 object detection model for real-time analysis, logs events to a PostgreSQL database, and sends instant alerts via Telegram.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Real-Time Detection**: Uses the YOLOv8 model with OpenCV to process multiple camera streams concurrently.
- **Persistent Storage**: Logs all detection events, daily statistics, and alert history in a PostgreSQL database for auditing and analysis.
- **Instant Notifications**: Sends detailed alerts with screenshots to a specified Telegram chat when a monitor's status changes.
- **Automated Reporting**: Generates and sends a daily summary report of all monitoring activities at midnight.
- **Scalable & Resilient**: Uses multi-threading to handle camera processing, alerts, and reporting independently. Includes automatic reconnection logic for lost camera streams.
- **Highly Configurable**: System behavior, database credentials, and camera streams are easily configured through a `cameras.json` file and environment variables.
- **GPU Accelerated**: Built to utilize CUDA for high-performance, real-time deep learning inference.
